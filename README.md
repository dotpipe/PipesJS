# Irondocks v 3.0.5

Small changes, reignited the Modala key of "br" for having "x" amount of HTML line breaks.

Updated "HOWTO"

Started automatic Listeners again

# Irondocks v3

Thankfully, I noticed that the '?' was missing in the URLs being AJAXed to. That's now fixed. Please bring up issues to me here. I'd love to fix them

Also, I figured that 'insert' is now a good way to address multi-changes. It's not necessary, but it's an addition. insert="id:incoming.foo;id2:incoming.bar;"

# Irondocks v2.8.3

Ahh how time flies. onclick is unnecessary. At all. If you wish to have a tag be active, ID it. It'll act with the rest of the code. Everything is good. But! Nested modals are a bit slow. Till a solution is found! goodnight!

# Irondocks v2.0

One very huge and important update here: { "modal": "foo.json" } is now the official nest key/value for inserting nested template files.
Must use "onclick": "pipes(this)" at any point you're going to be using Invents. The name pipes() is not going to be deprecated. It will be an alias at some point.

# Irondocks v1.0

Irondocks is a JSON structure-mapped HTML translator where you can create templates, and offer more pages to users with less code. It's a run away hit when you notice how fun it is. Used with Invents it's as perfectly harmonizing as any other framework. Give it a go. It's at least worthy of a look. Just clone and use Invents. Affix the JSON of HTML to the function

modala({"key": "pair",...}, rootNode);

and run it on the page you want. That said, you will need to make one value, the delay attribute can be used to state that you want your timers all to use TimeOuts every x milliseconds.

At that point in Irondocks, Invents will have a future of being created in Irondocks. But this is far off. The Irondocks package, as it sets, is a rich and heavily blendable template. This is because you can write JSONs in such languages as PHP, and it can be given to the Irondocks interpreter. Very keen I think.

Another problem with Irondocks, though, is that it doesn't create subpages from the function. It strictly sticks to the first page. Again, this is JS's fault and if I find another way, I will. But you can call and replace more than one DOM Node at a time. This is seen in test.php. The example shows more than one timed function going on. And as it is, the templates can work with changing data. So, no loss of utility really happens within Irondocks huge exterior from nesting out-of-the-box information when trying to scale for template use. That means we have a great ability to give you complete control over your coding. Your wish is in a command. It's a strong adversary to the others out there. With a tenth of the learning time. Honestly? it's as always HTML with more specs you know you need in a way you love. Thanks for choosing Invents. I appreciate it.
